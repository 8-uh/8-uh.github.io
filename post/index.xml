      <description>Part One: Getting Started First Things First: Everything&amp;rsquo;s Gonna Be Just Fine Hey, remember when ES6 first started coming on the scene and you were like:
It started gaining traction, new libraries were being written in it, yet still you were like:
Then friends, family, co-workers, and YouTube subscribers all started using it, and yet&amp;hellip;
It&amp;rsquo;s ok, little bird. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna tell you a secret:

      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what Mode-7 is, then allow me a moment to enlighten you (well, allow me to copy the summary from Wikipedia).
 Mode 7 is a graphics mode on the Super NES video game console that allows a background layer to be rotated and scaled on a scanline-by-scanline basis to create many different effects. The most famous of these effects is the application of a perspective effect on a background layer by scaling and rotating the background layer in this manner.</description>

      <description>It has recently come to my attention that there is some confusion in the javascript community as to the usage of const. If you&amp;rsquo;ll allow me a few minutes and artistic license to butcher the -actual- underpinnings of memory management and registration in the V8 engine, I&amp;rsquo;ll attempt to explain how const operates at the lowest-level possible. But know now, If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a simple answer regarding when to use const, well, buddy, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the article for you.</description>
